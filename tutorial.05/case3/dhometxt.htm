         <p>
            <b>dHome</b> is the leading manufacturer of dome structures 
            in the world. Our domes are built to exacting standards using 
            the highest quality materials. We've been building domes for over
            35 years and have a proven track record of providing quality 
            homes at reasonable prices.
         </p>

         <p>
            A dome house provides you with a totally new living experience 
            in a spacious and open environment. Imagine a curved ceiling more 
            than 20 feet high with skylights bringing the beauty of the outdoors 
            into your home.
         </p>

         <p>Domes are stronger and safer than conventional homes, and their 
            design provides more stability against hurricanes, tornados, and 
            earthquakes. Dome houses are also more energy efficient. A dome home 
            has approximately 30 to 50% less roof and wall area exposed to the 
            elements than conventional homes, resulting in reduced energy costs.
            The spherical space also provides for a natural air flow, minimizing 
            cold spots and increasing interior comfort.
